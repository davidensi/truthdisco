# truthdisco - decentralised truth-discovery.

This system was developed as part of my masters thesis at the University of Queensland.


To install the node software (hardhat etc):

npm install

To run the node: 

npx hardhat node

To deploy the smart contracts: 

npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js


The web app is accessible from /frontend

cd frontend

npm install //to install

npm run serve //Start the server. 

Currently, it's only configured to work with MetaMask.  

Have fun!
